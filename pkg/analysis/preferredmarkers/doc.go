/*
* The `preferredmarkers` linter ensures that types and fields use preferred markers
* instead of equivalent but different marker identifiers.
*
* By default, `preferredmarkers` is not enabled.
*
* This linter is useful for projects that want to enforce consistent marker usage
* across their codebase, especially when multiple equivalent markers exist.
* For example, Kubernetes has multiple ways to mark fields as optional:
* - `+k8s:optional`
* - `+kubebuilder:validation:Optional`
*
* The linter can be configured to enforce using one preferred marker identifier
* and report any equivalent markers that should be replaced.
*
* **Configuration:**
*
* The linter requires a configuration that specifies preferred markers and their
* equivalent identifiers.
*
* **Scenario:** Enforce using `+k8s:optional` instead of `+kubebuilder:validation:Optional`
*
* ```yaml
* linterConfig:
*   preferredmarkers:
*     markers:
*       - preferredIdentifier: "k8s:optional"
*         equivalentIdentifiers:
*           - "kubebuilder:validation:Optional"
* ```
*
* **Scenario:** Enforce using a custom marker instead of multiple equivalent markers
*
* ```yaml
* linterConfig:
*   preferredmarkers:
*     markers:
*       - preferredIdentifier: "custom:preferred"
*         equivalentIdentifiers:
*           - "custom:old:marker"
*           - "custom:deprecated:marker"
*           - "custom:legacy:marker"
* ```
*
* **Scenario:** Multiple preferred markers with different equivalents
*
* ```yaml
* linterConfig:
*   preferredmarkers:
*     markers:
*       - preferredIdentifier: "k8s:optional"
*         equivalentIdentifiers:
*           - "kubebuilder:validation:Optional"
*       - preferredIdentifier: "k8s:required"
*         equivalentIdentifiers:
*           - "kubebuilder:validation:Required"
* ```
*
* **Behavior:**
*
* When one or more equivalent markers are found, the linter will:
* 1. Report a diagnostic message indicating which marker(s) should be preferred
* 2. Suggest a fix that:
*    - If the preferred marker does not already exist: replaces the first equivalent
*      marker with the preferred identifier and preserves any marker expressions
*      (e.g., `:=value` or `:key=value`)
*    - If the preferred marker already exists: removes all equivalent markers to
*      avoid duplicates
*    - Removes any additional equivalent markers
*
* For example, if both `+kubebuilder:validation:Optional` and `+custom:optional`
* are configured as equivalents to `+k8s:optional`, they will both be replaced
* with a single `+k8s:optional` marker. If `+k8s:optional` already exists alongside
* equivalent markers, only the equivalent markers will be removed.
*
* The linter checks both type-level and field-level markers, including markers
* inherited from type aliases.
